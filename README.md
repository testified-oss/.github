# Community Files

A collection of standardized community health files for open source projects.

## Overview

This repository contains a set of default community health files that can be used across multiple repositories. These files help maintain consistency in community interactions, contribution guidelines, and project governance.

## Files Included

- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` - Issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` - Template for pull requests
- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` - Project code of conduct (Contributor Covenant)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - Guidelines for contributing to the project
- `SECURITY.md` - Security policy and vulnerability reporting
- `SUPPORT.md` - Where to get help and support

## Usage

GitHub will use these files for any repository within the organization that doesn't have its own file of that type. To learn more about default community health files, see [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).

## Customization

While these files provide a good starting point, you may want to customize them for specific repositories. Simply create the corresponding file in that repository to override the default version.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve these community files. Please read our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting changes.
